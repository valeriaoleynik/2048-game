# 2048 Game
- [DEMO LINK](https://valeriaoleynik.github.io/2048-game/)

## DESCRIPTION
This is my web-based implementation of the well-known game 2048.

Here are some rules of 2048:

1. The game begins with two tiles already on the grid, each with a value of either 2 or 4.
2. The player can move cells with keyboard arrows.
3. Combine tiles with the same number to create larger numbers.
4. After move 2 or 4 appears in a random empty cell.
5. The game ends when 2048 value is displayed in any cel, or if there are no more available moves.
